1. Replace pk 'user_id' (mapped from table 'users)' in tables: 'user_descriptions', 'user_credentials' and 'user_notifications' with artificial ids. Reason was shared pk make impossible lazy loading when entity from 'users' table was fetched cause each time entities from tables with shared key also were fetched.
2. Put fk to tables: 'user_descriptions', 'user_credentials' and 'user_notifications' to 'users' to let lazy loading work properly.
3. Rename table 'reactions_on_university_reviews' to 'university_review_reactions'. Adjust pk name to change in table name.
4. Add 'deleted_at' column to 'university_reviews' table.
5. Add 'deleted_at' column to 'universities' table.
6. Change reference in 'user_roles' table now reference to 'user_credentials' table is on 'user_credential_id' column.
7. Change orders of executing scripts in 'data' directory.
